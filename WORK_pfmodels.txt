Initialize local git repository
  git init
  (moved and linked to Scott's Dropbox gits directory)
	  mv .git ~/Desktop/scotts_gits/pfmodels_git
		ln -s !$ .git
	copied over a .gitignore file containing:
	    __pycache__
			.ropeproject
			*.swp
			*.pyc
	git add -A .
	git commit -am "Initial commit of pymodels.  First versions of help files included"
	(Had 'git add'ed before .gitignore file, so .swp files were included,
	  so new git commit after 'git rm'ing them)
