The master list of work done on the pfmodels project

Each entry below should:
 - be dated
 - describe what was done such that it could be re-done
 - discuss why this was done, and if appropriate why something else wasn't done


#----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Previous
  - a few discussions between Echin and Scott about what needs to be done
	- a few discussions with Mark P about how to set up bmi-python and github
	- Python notebook from Elchin with initial coding of Nelson/Outcalt model
	  - ~/nelson
	- Copy of GIPL code from Elchin

Initial documents created in this project: scotts::~/pfmodels/
  README_pfmodels.txt

Initialize local git repository
  git init
  (moved and linked to Scott's Dropbox gits directory)
	  mv .git ~/Desktop/scotts_gits/pfmodels_git
		ln -s !$ .git
	copied over a .gitignore file containing:
	    __pycache__
			.ropeproject
			*.swp
			*.pyc
	git add -A .
	git commit -am "Initial commit of pymodels.  First versions of help files included"
	(Had 'git add'ed before .gitignore file, so .swp files were included,
	  so new git commit after 'git rm'ing them)

Get copy of bmi-python
  git clone https://github.com/csdms/bmi-python
	Note: this new .gitignore from bmi-python is awesome!  Added:
	  - .*.swp 
		- .ropeproject
	Moved this .gitignore to ~/pfmodels/
	remove the .git folder from the newly (here) created bmi-python directory:
	  cd bmi-python
		rm -rf .git
		(Note: left the .gitmodules file here.  Not sure what to do with it)
		cd ..
	Updated local .git 
	  git add -A .
		git commit -am "Cloned bmi-python, using new .gitignore, removed bmi-python/.git"

In bmi-python/, try nosetests (under Anaconda Python 2.7 environment)
  30 tests okay!

Create a local python package of bmi-heat
  - From ~/pfmodels/bmi-python/heat, run:
      python setup.py develop
        - the 'develop' command means that if changes are made in the
          bmi-heat module, they will be incorporated when any code
          uses it
  - Had some issues with relative imports, so had to change some import
    statements from
        from .heat import Heat
      to
        from heat import Heat

Work in bmi-python/heat/; Attempt to run the heat model
  Create a new file: runheat.py
	Attempt to make as "Python3-like" as possible, per:
	  http://python-future.org/imports.html
	python runheat.py

Create a new python file -- "runheat.py" -- to very simply experiment with
  how to set up and run code that uses the bmi-heat module
  - Run from ~/pfmodels/bmi-python/heat/
      python runheat.py
  - Outputs 'heatseries.dat' which can be read from ImageJ as
    - Import->Raw, 32-bit real, 20wide x 10high with 100 images
